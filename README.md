# Code-Scroller

Program to output sourcefiles as though they were being typed, includes syntax highlighting.

Please feel free to add any nonsense source files to the sources repo, nothing is executed.
I included this program's source already, though the original.

Credit to Co-Pilot and OpenAPI, Co-Pilot couldn't figure out the sytax highlighting

TODO 
Attempted to include the ability to allow users to change settings while the script was running. 
If someone knows how to add a key press event handler I would be grateful.
